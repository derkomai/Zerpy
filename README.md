# Zerpy

Zerpy is a minimal account manager for the XRP ledger. With Zerpy, you can check your
transactions and send XRP from multiple XRPL addresses.

Warning: Zerpy is in alpha stage. Please use carefully. Use it only with test accounts or low-value
accounts. Never share your account secret and be careful storing it.
